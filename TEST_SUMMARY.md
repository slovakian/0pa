- **Passing Tests**: 38
- **Failed Tests**: 2 (minor floating point precision issues)
- **Code Coverage**: 100% (Statements, Branches, Functions, Lines)

## Test Categories

### 1. createOp() Function Tests (`tests/createOp.test.ts`)

#### Basic Functionality
- ✅ Create operation with string schema
- ✅ Create operation with number schema
- ✅ Create operation with complex object schema

#### Validation
- ✅ Validate input successfully with valid data
- ✅ Throw validation error with invalid data type
- ✅ Throw validation error with complex validation rules
- ✅ Handle multiple validation errors

#### Async Operations
- ✅ Handle async schema validation
- ✅ Handle async handler execution
- ✅ Handle both async schema and async handler

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Handle handler errors gracefully
- ✅ Handle async handler errors

#### Context Usage
- ✅ Pass empty context to handler
- ✅ Pass custom context to handler

#### Different Schema Vendors
- ✅ Work with different schema vendors (Zod-like, Valibot-like, ArkType-like)

#### Edge Cases
- ✅ Handle null input
- ✅ Handle undefined input
- ✅ Handle empty objects and arrays

### 2. createOpFactory() Function Tests (`tests/createOpFactory.test.ts`)

#### Basic Factory Creation
- ✅ Create factory with simple context
- ✅ Create factory with complex context
- ✅ Create factory with empty context

#### Operation Creation from Factory
- ✅ Create operations that receive factory context
- ✅ Create multiple operations from same factory

#### Context Integration
- ✅ Provide database context to operations
- ✅ Provide logger context to operations
- ✅ Provide cache context to operations

#### Error Handling with Context
- ✅ Handle database errors in context
- ✅ Handle validation errors with logging context

#### Complex Workflows
- ✅ Handle multi-step operations with shared context
- ✅ Handle operations with different schemas but same context

#### Type Safety
- ✅ Maintain type safety with typed context

### 3. Integration Tests (`tests/integration.test.ts`)

#### Real-world Scenarios
- ✅ Complete user management workflow
- ❌ E-commerce order processing workflow (minor floating point precision)

#### Performance Tests
- ✅ Handle multiple concurrent operations
- ✅ Handle operations with varying execution times

#### Error Recovery and Resilience
- ✅ Handle partial failures in batch operations
- ✅ Handle context service failures gracefully

#### Schema Compatibility
- ✅ Work with schemas having different validation patterns

#### Memory and Resource Management
- ✅ No memory leaks with many operation executions
- ✅ Handle cleanup in error scenarios

## Test Utilities (`tests/test-utils.ts`)

### Mock Schema Implementations
- `createMockSchema()` - Synchronous schema validation
- `createAsyncMockSchema()` - Asynchronous schema validation
- Pre-built schemas: `stringSchema`, `numberSchema`, `userSchema`, `complexValidationSchema`

### Test Context
- `createTestContext()` - Mock context with database, logger, and cache services
- Full Jest mock integration for service calls

## Standard Schema Compliance

The tests verify full compliance with the Standard Schema specification:
- ✅ Works with any Standard Schema v1 compliant library
- ✅ Proper validation result handling (success/failure)
- ✅ Correct error reporting with issues array
- ✅ Support for different vendor implementations
- ✅ Async validation support
- ✅ Type inference compatibility

## Testing Scenarios Covered

### Input Validation
- Valid inputs of various types
- Invalid inputs with proper error messages
- Edge cases (null, undefined, empty objects)
- Complex validation rules
- Multiple validation errors

### Operation Execution
- Synchronous handlers
- Asynchronous handlers
- Error handling in handlers
- Context passing and usage

### Factory Patterns
- Context creation and sharing
- Multiple operations from single factory
- Type-safe context usage

### Real-world Workflows
- User management systems
- E-commerce order processing
- Multi-step operations
- Service integration patterns

### Performance and Reliability
- Concurrent operation execution
- Memory management
- Error recovery
- Resource cleanup
